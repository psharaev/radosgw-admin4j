# About
**radosgw-admin4j** is a powerful Ceph object storage admin client designed for provisioning and managing Ceph object storage deployments. It offers a wide range of features, including user and subuser management, quota control, usage reporting, and bucket/object management, among others.

# Highlights
- **Full Support for All [Operations](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/adminops/)**: We fully support all operations, including subuser and quota management, for the latest Ceph versions.
- Simplified Radosgw Management: Manage your radosgw instance with ease, avoiding the complexities often associated with radosgw admin APIs.
- Quality and Compatibility: Our codebase undergoes continuous integration and testing against active Ceph releases, including **Octopus**, **Pacific**, **Quincy**, and **Reef**.
- Contributor-Friendly: We welcome contributions with a straightforward contribution process and no unusual policies.

# Getting Started

## Add Dependency

You can include radosgw-admin4j in your project by adding the following Maven Central dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.twonote</groupId>
    <artifactId>radosgw-admin4j</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.8</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
</dependency>
```

## Configuration

```java
RgwAdmin rgwAdmin = new RgwAdminBuilder()
    .accessKey("administrator access key")
    .secretKey("administrator secret key")
    .endpoint("radosgw admin endpoint, e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin")
    .build();
```

## Usage Example

We offer a comprehensive set of operations, including User, Subuser, Key, Bucket, Capability, Quota, and Usage. Please refer to the [![Javadocs](https://www.javadoc.io/badge/io.github.twonote/radosgw-admin4j.svg)](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.github.twonote/radosgw-admin4j/latest/org/twonote/rgwadmin4j/RgwAdmin.html) for all available operations.

### User Management

```java
// List users in the system
List<User> users = rgwAdmin.listUserInfo();

// Create a user
rgwAdmin.createUser(userId);

// Get user information and display keys
User user = rgwAdmin.getUserInfo(userId).get();
user.getS3Credentials().forEach(System.out::println);

// Create a subuser
SubUser subUser = rgwAdmin.createSubUser(userId, "subUserId", SubUser.Permission.FULL, CredentialType.SWIFT);

// Suspend a user
rgwAdmin.suspendUser(userId, true);

// Remove a user
rgwAdmin.removeUser(userId);
```

### Quota Management

```java
// Allow the user to own more buckets
rgwAdmin.modifyUser(userId, ImmutableMap.of("max-buckets", String.valueOf(Integer.MAX_VALUE)));

// Set a quota that limits the user to a maximum of one thousand objects and a maximum usage of 1 GiB
rgwAdmin.setUserQuota(userId, 1000, 1048576);
```

### Bucket Management

```java
// Transfer the bucket ownership from the user to the administrator
BucketInfo bucketInfo = rgwAdmin.getBucketInfo(bucketName).get();
rgwAdmin.linkBucket(bucketName, bucketInfo.getId(), adminUserId);

// Remove a bucket
rgwAdmin.removeBucket(bucketName);
```

### Usage Report

```java
// Retrieve and display the usage report for a given user
UsageInfo userUsage = rgwAdmin.getUserUsage(userId).get();
userUsage.getSummary().forEach(System.out::println);
```

## One More Thing: Radosgw Setup

To get started, you need a ready-to-use radosgw instance and an admin account with the necessary capabilities. Here's how you can set up a radosgw instance:

### If You Don't Have a Radosgw Setup

1. You can refer to the [Ceph official manual](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/start/) for a quick Ceph cluster setup. If you're not familiar with Ceph, this may be a bit challenging. An easier approach is available if you have **Docker** in your environment. To set up a standalone instance with an admin account using the [Ceph daemon Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ceph/daemon/), follow these instructions:

   ```bash
   $ docker run -d -p 80:8080 -v /etc/ceph/:/etc/ceph/ -e CEPH_DEMO_UID=qqq -e CEPH_DEMO_ACCESS_KEY=qqq -e CEPH_DEMO_SECRET_KEY=qqq -e NETWORK_AUTO_DETECT=4 --name rgw ceph/daemon:v6.0.3-stable-6.0-pacific-centos-8-x86_64 demo
   ```

   Note that port 80 should be available.

2. It takes about two minutes to initialize the Ceph cluster. Check if the setup succeeded with the following command:

   ```bash
   $ timeout 120 bash -c "until docker logs rgw &> rgw.log && grep SUCCESS rgw.log; do sleep 1; done"
   ```

3. Once the setup is complete, you can run radosgw-admin4j tests without any additional configuration on the client side since the [default config](https://github.com/twonote/radosgw-admin4j/blob/master/src/test/resources/rgwadmin.properties) should suffice. Run tests with the following commands:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/twonote/radosgw-admin4j.git
   $ cd radosgw-admin4j
   $ mvn test
   ```

### If You Already Have a Radosgw Instance

1. First, ensure you have an admin account. If not, create the account with the following commands:

   ```bash
   $ radosgw-admin user create --uid=qqq --display-name="qqq" --access-key=qqq --secret-key=qqq
   $ radosgw

-admin --id admin caps add --caps="buckets=*;users=*;usage=*;metadata=*" --uid=qqq
   ```

2. Enter the key pair (qqq,qqq) and add your radosgw endpoint to the [config file](https://github.com/twonote/radosgw-admin4j/blob/master/src/test/resources/rgwadmin.properties).

3. Note that radosgw does not enable [usage log](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/admin/#usage) by default. If you need this feature or plan to run test cases, make sure you enable the usage log in your Ceph config file. For example, in your ceph.conf:

   ```ini
   ...
   [client.radosgw.gateway]
   rgw enable usage log = true
   rgw usage log tick interval = 1
   rgw usage log flush threshold = 1
   rgw usage max shards = 32
   rgw usage max user shards = 1
   ...
   ```

That's it!
